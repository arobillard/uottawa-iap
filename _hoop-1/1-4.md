  Respond to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action and fulfill our commitment to the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation in 2017
why: |-
  On March 22, 2017, uOttawa signed an MOU with the University of Manitoba in which we agreed to contribute materially to the purposes and objectives of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. While several faculties, including Law, Education, and Medicine, have begun implementing formal responses to the TRC (see attached), uOttawa has not, as yet, developed its institutional response or determined how it will fulfill its obligations under the MOU.

  We will begin a comprehensive survey and review what other faculties have done to support the Calls to Action, in order to determine the best plan to move forward as a university and address these calls, while reviewing the MOU to determine how to meet our commitments.
when: |-
  Short-term start, medium-term completion
how: |-
  This is a multi-staged, and multi-year process to take place between 2019-2024:

  1. Hold a president’s town hall on the TRC and MOU to underscore and encourage University-wide participation.
  2. Simultaneously, establish a process (appointment of a committee, etc.) by which we decide what Calls to Action uOttawa needs to/is best positioned to address given its institutional needs, capacity, and mission; initiate a survey of what each faculty, department and unit has undertaken, or what it currently has in terms of curriculum and supports, in order to determine what actions must be taken.
  3. All senior managers, including VPs, AVPs, heads of services, deans, VDs, and department/institute chairs, should have their job descriptions amended to include responsibility for implementing the TRC Calls to Action.
  4. Once the process is created and an assessment is undertaken, develop a response to these Calls to Action that makes the most sense in the context of uOttawa.
  5. Until 2024, the University should require annual updates from all faculties, department, and units on their progress toward meeting the Calls to Action. These reports will be public documents, made available on the Indigenous Portal.
cost: |-
  Faculties need to commit to determining how the Calls to Action are reflected in their curricula and then commit the appropriate resources to either developing new courses or ensuring that they have the appropriate staffing to ensure that courses that already exist are offered. In some instances, this will necessitate the hiring of Indigenous instructors.
 
  The University of Ottawa will commit to ensuring that the commitments of the MOU are met. As a partner, we’ve agreed to a number of actions, including ensuring that the Centre’s archives are more accessible and used, contributing additional holdings to the Centre’s archives and supporting a broad scope of public education, research and other reconciliation activities. As an institution founded by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a Catholic male religious order, uOttawa has a direct historical link to the residential schools themselves. With its ongoing relationship to Saint Paul University, and, as a result, the Deschâtelets Archive of the Oblates, along with its own institutional archive, uOttawa must task its archivists and librarians to work with Saint Paul and the Oblate archive to build an institutional history of the University that reflects its connection to the establishment and operation of Indian residential schools.
