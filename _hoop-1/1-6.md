  Hire Indigenous curriculum specialists within the Teaching Learning and Support Service (TLSS)
why: |-
  A dedicated position for an Indigenous curriculum specialist within the TLSS will be created in order to help faculties, departments and professors develop content, courses and curriculum that reflect Indigenization, decolonization, and empowerment.

  This specialist will assist interested uOttawa professors (full and part time) to redesign their courses and programs, as well as work to develop new courses, to include appropriate Indigenous content in a way that supports their disciplinary specializations. The specialist will also work to introduce Indigenous research methodologies to faculties, departments and professors. This position is integral to Indigenizing the curriculum and creating additional course offerings for those students interested in pursuing this area of learning. Furthermore, as the realities of Tri-Council funding shift in post-TRC Canada, faculty need to understand that Indigenization supports their research efforts, and research productivity is critical to transforming the curriculum.

  The specialist will also assist with the FNMI 101 course and onboarding new faculty, staff, and members of the BOG and Senate, because they will be the person who can gather the network of experts needed for Hoop 1.5.
