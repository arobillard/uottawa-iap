  Develop Indigenous competency courses for faculty, staff, Board of Governors members and members of the Senate from outside uOttawa
why: |-
  All faculty and staff will be required to complete a First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) 101 workshop including competency modules related to their specific employment sector. For instance, the finance teams should understand the many different ways by which Indigenous students are funded to attend postsecondary institutions. At the same time, all staff should know the legal and socio-cultural differences between FNMI peoples, and be aware of treaties, scrip, UNDRIP, the Indian Act, and other colonial laws and policies that continue to affect all Canadians, in order to have a better understanding of the contexts in which the University’s Indigenous students, faculty, and staff live.
when: |-
  Medium term
how: |-
  The FNMI 101 competency course and attendant modules will initially be offered in face to face sessions to current employees by the staff from Indigenous Affairs and/or faculty and staff with expertise, but they will also be transformed into a hybrid offering with a combined in-person and online interface that will be used by future employees  as a part of their onboarding. This is already done with the University at a Glance workshops, so we have a framework for such onboarding practices already in place.
  
  It is especially critical for the University to create a network (in French and English) of expertise in Indigenous realities and issues. This involves training deans to train deans, professors to train professors, department chairs to train department chairs, and key leaders in services to train others in service sectors. An online module can provide general content knowledge, but these modules must be followed up by in-person action planning workshops led by experts within the realm of those taking the competency training in order to bridge the two realities of Indigenization and the particular position, discipline and/or service area.
cost: |-
  A central budgetary commitment to develop the FNMI 101 and specific modules related to each employment sector:

  - Current FNMI faculty could be provided with course relief to begin building Indigenous 101 in consultation with the Indigenous Affairs team and the TLSS, to develop the modules for an online interface.
  - The Teaching and Learning Support Service (TLSS) will hire content specialists (on contract/module) when necessary in order to work with Indigenous Affairs on the faculty, department and unit-specific modules.

  The TLSS has the resource capacity to manage much of this work. Each faculty may need to assist in the development of its own modules via financial or in-kind contributions.
