  Develop Indigenous faculty recruitment and hiring policy for tenure-track and part-time positions
why: |-
  Other U15 universities are making strong commitments in this area. To keep pace as a leading research institution, uOttawa must establish a competitive and comprehensive recruitment strategy for hiring Indigenous faculty members. This strategy is directly tied to national research funding, since Tri-Council allocations are increasingly dedicated to Indigenous-focused research led by Indigenous academics in partnership with Indigenous communities. For uOttawa to have access to these types of research funds, it must increase the numbers of Indigenous researchers. Such a strategy will ensure that uOttawa continues to be regarded as a leading research-intensive institution.

how: |-
  Select tactics to give us a competitive edge, such as:
  - Locate and offer tenure-track positions to Indigenous people from the local area (Quebec and Ontario) currently enrolled in doctoral programs and find ways to support them as they complete their programs before they take up these permanent positions.
  - Hire Indigenous scholars for positions, though they will not assume their responsibilities as faculty until year two. Instead, provide bridge funding in year one that supports them to finish their dissertations and start publishing. Their appointments as faculty members will be conditional on their completion of the dissertation.
  - The University (via the faculty or department they are hired into) must provide them with mentoring/assistance to be able to complete their studies.
  - Create more bursaries and scholarships for Indigenous graduate students. There is a lack of sufficient funding within communities to support First Nations, Inuit, and Metis students through graduate programming.
cost: |-
  Departments and faculties need to commit resources to hiring a range of Indigenous scholars—tenure-track and part-time—in the interest of broader equity and diversity. This process will comply with the beyond self-ID Indigenous hiring policy (in draft form as yet):
  - Hiring Indigenous scholars regardless of whether or not they do “Indigenous- based” scholarship, in order to have a full and rich complement of professors from Indigenous societies.
  - Committing to hiring at all ranks: assistant, associate, and full professor.
  - Creating a complement of tenure-track professors requires central allocation of special funding for cluster hires.
  - Committing to hiring part-time instructors either with PhDs in the required discipline or MAs if they have the appropriate professional background and/or competencies in Indigenous knowledge.
