  Create a Housing Service Living Learning Community (LLC) for Indigenous learners
why: |-
  An LLC within the uOttawa Housing Service is a dedicated space in one of uOttawa’s residence facilities where residents are grouped according to their interest in a particular area.

  Programming for LLCs focuses on these areas of interest and offers enhanced opportunities for connection and development beyond the classroom.

  The University will establish an LCC for Indigenous students in one of the residence buildings. This space will have the capacity for students to engage in traditional spiritual practices (such as smudging and/or lighting the qulliq) without requiring permission from Ottawa Fire Services and uOttawa Protection Services.

  The Housing Service will work with the staff at Mashkawazìwogamig to ensure that appropriate activities and principles are established for this dedicated LLC.
when: |-
  Long term
how: |-
  Work with the Housing Service to locate appropriate floors in appropriate residence buildings that will be preapproved for traditional ceremonies.
cost: |-
  No additional cost since students already pay for the cost of the LLCs via their residence fees. However, additional administrative costs may be incurred during the startup phase of the LCC.

  N/A
