  Establishment of an emergency travel fund

when: |-
  Short to medium term, following needs assessment.
how: |-
  Work with Financial Aid and Awards to determine how many scholarships and bursaries dedicated to Indigenous learners are not currently applied for and then implement a plan to redirect the unspent funds to establish an emergency travel fund for those students who need to travel home unexpectedly during the school year.
cost: |-
  Funds already exist, so this is an issue of reallocation, not creation.
