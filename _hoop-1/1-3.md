  Ensure and maintain a minimum of two Indigenous members on the Board of Governors and Senate
why: |-
  There is an insufficient number of Indigenous staff members.

  Two complementary but different needs have been identified to increase numbers of Indigenous staff members:
  - Each faculty should commit to hiring an Indigenous coordinator to draft and implement its Indigenization plans, support curriculum enhancements and advise students in terms of their programs. To ensure coordination of efforts related to student success, faculty support and other initiatives campus-wide, this complement of Indigenous coordinators will report to the University’s director of Indigenous affairs.
  - To meet targets of diversity, inclusion and equity, Human Resources must have a plan to ensure that Indigenous applicants are able to access and apply for positions throughout the University.
when: |-
  Medium term
how: |-
  Faculties will need to prioritize the creation of an Indigenous coordinator position; Human Resources must prioritize the hiring of Indigenous staff; an appropriate environment fostering language support should be provided (see below).
cost: |-
  Indigenous coordinators working with the Office of Indigenous Affairs will be able to effectively share resources with a goal towards increasing the overall campus PEFAL allocation as well as applying to external bodies for special event funding. However, each faculty will assume the salary cost for these positions. Additionally, each faculty will have its own budget, which its coordinator will manage. However, everyone should be aware of what is being spent and how it is spent in order to ensure faculties, the Indigenous Resource Centre and the director’s office are not working at cross purposes.

  Budgets for staffing positions already exist within faculties and the hiring of Indigenous peoples at all levels of the University workforce will not affect that process (although positions themselves may require reallocation).

  Indigenous people tend to speak either English or French (not both) and, if they speak a second language, are more likely to speak their own mother tongue. Therefore, it will be necessary for the University to build into its Human Resources recruitment strategy a recognition of this linguistic barrier and identify strategies and means by which Indigenous staff can become bilingual in French and English at the same time that they are supported and encouraged to learn their own language (if they do not know it already). This is in the interests of reconciliation, which includes efforts to preserve Indigenous languages.
