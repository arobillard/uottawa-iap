  Create new internship placements and co-op opportunities
why: |-
  Ottawa is home to all of the major governance organizations (federal government departments as well as AFN, MNC, NWAC, ITK, CAP, etc.), national heritage organizations (NAC, LAC, NAG, etc.) and community support service organizations (Minwashin Lodge, Wabano Centre, Odawa, etc.), ideal employers/placements for co- op and internship opportunities that will enhance student experience.
when: |-
  Long term
how: |-
  The CO-OP Office will work with the Indigenous Affairs team (with the expectation that there are designated support staff within various faculties) to develop and facilitate placements with Indigenous and Canadian governance bodies/organizations and the national heritage institutions for co-op placements designed for Indigenous learners.
cost: |-
  Resource implications are low. The administrative infrastructure for the development of co-op and other placements is already in place.

  Success relies on the ability of the University to make meaningful connections and relationships with the governance bodies, organizations and heritage centres. To be able to do this effectively, we need to ensure that faculties interested in developing such programs are prepared, by first hiring the appropriate support staff of Indigenous affairs coordinators (see Hoop #1, item #3), who will work with the director of Indigenous affairs, the team at Mashkawaz√¨wogamig and the CO-OP Office.
