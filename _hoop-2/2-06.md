  Create Indigenous first year student pathway
why: |-
  Recognizing that first-year students come to the university from a variety of backgrounds and informed by multiple experiences, our intent is to develop a pathway with academically-grounded programming that builds the confidence, knowledge and skills to be successful. At the same time, we will connect them to one another and our campus community. Students in this pathway will be brought together as a Learning Community. This Indigenous Learning Community will begin their university careers surrounded by students with similar interests and goals, be introduced to programs and colleges across campus related to their interests, and be assigned peer mentors— a team of expert learners—who will help first-year students develop the academic skills needed to flourish. The University will establish this program through the shared participation of Indigenous Affairs and SASS who can collaborate with the appropriate faculties to develop core academic support programs to nurture an annual cohort of Indigenous learners following admission and registration. Indigenous course components should be a core requirement within this pathway.
when: |-
  Medium term
how: |-
  Planning will be undertaken and managed by Indigenous Affairs, the Office of the Registrar, and SASS and will involve those faculties such as Arts, Social Sciences, and Science with BA and BSc programs to negotiate the right course structure.
cost: |-
  Tuition can be the vehicle to support this program and the mentorship/tutoring supports, but there may be some costs associated with the administrative startup. We will consult with FNMI governing bodies to ensure that the pathway developed is fundable based on their financial procedures/requirements.
who: |-
  Provost, academic and administrative support units as required
