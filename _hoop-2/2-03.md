  Transition of the Institute of Canadian and Aboriginal Studies into an Institute of Indigenous Research and Studies that has a cross-faculty mandate
why: |-
  uOttawa recruited two Tier 2 CRCs in Indigenous Intellectual Traditions, who will begin work at uOttawa in 2019–2020 and has the Chair in Métis Research, a provincially endowed chair that has existed since 2010. With these three research chairs, as well as a strong cohort of Indigenous faculty (those already here and those to be hired), uOttawa can move forward with building an interdisciplinary research centre, housed in, and supported by, the now renamed Institute of Indigenous Research and Studies, focused on cutting edge research methodologies specific to Indigenous scholars. While the name has changed, additional work needs to be done to build IIRS in a manner that fulfills its potential.
when: |-
  Medium term
how: |-
  This requires the collaboration of the VP research in order to include planning for the Research Centre and Institute policy, work that’s already underway.
cost: |-
  Space needs be provided in a manner that draws together scholars engaged in Indigenous research and fosters collaborative interaction. The Indigenous Studies program is currently housed in William Commanda Hall, and for the time being that space is adequate. However, as this initiative grows, a new allocation of space will be required.

  IT, special projects, financial and academic administration, and research outreach support will be required to assist with the administration of the academic and research programs within the Indigenous Studies and Research Centre.
