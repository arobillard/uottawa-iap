  Indigenous Research Preparedness, Protocols, and the Office of Research Ethics and Integrity
why: |-
  There are practical, ethical, and moral considerations involved in working with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, which have cultural and procedural requirements based on their own governing practices and expectations. Faculty and students at uOttawa should be aware of these considerations when developing their Indigenous-focused research projects.

  Within Indigenous communities, the most widely referenced framework for governance over research, community knowledge and data, is known as <a href="https://fnigc.ca/ocapr.html">OCAP</a>:
  - Ownership: Indigenous communities have ownership over their information and cultural knowledge.
  - Control: Indigenous communities have control over how their information is used or accessed—and must be consulted and give informed consent to all stages of the research cycle.
  - Access: Indigenous communities must have access to their own information and ultimately decide on group and individual access rights based on cultural needs and protocols.
  - Possession: Indigenous communities are stewards of their own information and data and responsible for its security.

  Many FNMI communities have developed research protocol agreements that researchers are required to consult and/or follow by any researcher working specifically with them but there are also university-specific statements, as well as the <a href="https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/tcps2-eptc2_2018_chapter9-chapitre9.html">Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, ch. 9</a>.

  Currently, uOttawa does not have a clear statement or protocol about how to undertake research with Indigenous communities, and that gap must be closed.
when: |-
  Medium term
how: |-
  During summer 2020, the academic delegate for Indigenous engagement and the Indigenous Affairs team will undertake a survey of best practices regarding Indigenous research protocols as developed by Indigenous communities/governing bodies, universities, and agencies that oversee institutional research, in order to begin developing a uOttawa Indigenous research protocol guide. Following that, we will work to implement this IRPG with the University of Ottawa’s Office of Research Ethics and Integrity.
cost: |-
  TBD
who: |-
  The academic delegate for Indigenous engagement will begin a consultation with the director of the Office of Research Ethics and Integrity.
