  Revitalize and support the Institute of Indigenous Research and	Studies
why: |-
  The program was created in 2004 at their behest of the Algonquin community with a view to making uOttawa a safer place for their young people and as such, it serves as the cornerstone of any uOttawa plans to Indigenize the campus.

  Any Canadian university seeking to be a world-class centre for research innovation must have a strong Indigenous studies program because it is the intellectual space in which the exploration of traditional knowledge as a body of thought can be undertaken within the cultural contexts that created it, and not as a comparative form of study. Furthermore, for research and teaching to be truly thoughtful and innovative, it requires dedicated spaces where Indigenous scholars are pushing the boundaries of 	existing disciplines, identifying and questioning disciplinary practice, and remaking field after field. This must be done in our university.
when: |-
  Short term to start, long term commitment
how: |-
  While preparing the paperwork to completely transform the program and its offerings by conceiving an Institute of Indigenous Research and Studies, the undergraduate EAS program underwent and is undergoing an external review. The external reviewers’ report supports the overall direction that the program is proposing—one centred on the hiring of a cohort of dedicated professors specializing in Indigenous studies and dedicated to Indigenous research methods and principles.

  The revitalized institute and program can tap into the enormous potential, in the National Capital Region by providing a professional master’s and a PhD program integrating Indigenous knowledge(s). Such programs will be of interest to people working in national Indigenous organizations and the federal government. Graduate- level programs build innovative research and the capacity that they build can help lead the academic Indigenization of uOttawa. Furthermore, the addition of graduate studies to EAS will service a region with no obvious competition; the nearest Indigenous studies graduate program is at Trent University, which offers collaborative graduate studies programming with Carleton. There are no stand-alone Indigenous studies graduate program in eastern Ontario.

  The only viable alternative to re-creating EAS is to shut down the program altogether. This would be an unmitigated disaster in terms of our relations with the local Algonquin community, as well as other local Indigenous communities and organizations, one that would put at risk all of the University’s Indigenization efforts and its research with Indigenous communities.
cost: |-
  Currently the program relies on the teaching of three cross-appointed professors in geography, history and political studies (and two of those three have direct contractual obligations and responsibilities to the program), a research chair whose courses are cross-listed to the program, an instructor on a limited term contract and a range of part-time professors. The program was allocated two new positions and hiring has taken place, with a Tier 2 CRC and regular faculty member in place January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2019 respectively. The Institute also received permission to hire two additional faculty members for 2020-21. While these hires are in the right direction, in and of themselves they are not enough to support the teaching needs of the undergraduate program, let alone build a graduate program. Indeed, the program needs to continue to grow if the University is to keep these new hires.

  Additionally, new tenure-track faculty members are needed to support the teaching program and the development of the institute’s research mandate. As recommended by the external evaluators, this must also include a senior Indigenous scholar with the administrative experience to develop a graduate program and to support the research junior faculty in establishing their careers.

  Funding for an Indigenous expert council to advise and support the department is required; their role will be to ensure that quality of the program in relation to community needs and inclusion of traditional knowledge.

  Support the establishment of a visiting scholar program, which will require space allocation and IT support but no other financial commitments.

  A fellowship located at the Institute for Indigenous PhD candidates who are in the last years of completing their dissertation would give uOttawa an edge in recruiting new faculty (see hoop 1.2 & hoop 2.5).
