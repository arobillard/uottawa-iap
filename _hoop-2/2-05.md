  Create pre- and post-doctoral positions for Indigenous graduate students and/or a series of dedicated scholarships and bursaries
why: |-
  To create pre- and postdoctoral positions as well as allocate scholarships and bursaries to support Indigenous graduate students to complete their studies. This will ensure that Indigenous graduate students are appropriately positioned to take their places in the academy.

  The University would benefit by having these graduate students teach at least one course and present their research. They would be paired with a supervisor/mentor within the institution for support and mentorship, which would, in turn, contribute to the building of sustainable relationships.
when: |-
  Medium to long term
how: |-
  There are several models uOttawa can adopt, for example:
  - Dartmouth offers the <a href="https://native-american.dartmouth.edu/research/charles-eastman-pre-doctoral-fellowship">Charles Eastman pre-doctoral fellowship</a>, the University of Michigan offers the <a href="https://rackham.umich.edu/funding/funding-types/rackham-predoctoral-fellowship-program/">Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship program</a>, Michigan State University offers the <a href="http://aisp.msu.edu/students/funding/pre-doctoral-fellowship/">Pre-doctoral Fellowship in American Indian and Indigenous Studies</a>, and Queenâ€™s University offers the <a href="https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/grad-studies-and-research/pre-doctoral-fellowships-for-indigenous-students">Pre-Doctoral Fellowship for Indigenous Students</a>.
cost: |-
  - Realistically, each faculty should be able to fund at least one such postdoc. 
  - Reallocation of some of the existing research development funding to ensure that there is institutional money available for supporting such post-docs. 
  - Can also work with External Relations to locate potential donors for the establishment of such a program. 
  - Faculties must commit a sessional stipend to ensure that these postdoctoral students teach, at a minimum, one class while in residence at uOttawa.
