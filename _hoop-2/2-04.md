  Create experiential learning opportunities for students
why: |-
  Undergraduate students have been asking for more experiential learning and research opportunities in, with, and for Indigenous communities. At this time, there are some opportunities available because of connections made by individual faculty members and their funded research programs, but there are no course-based experiential learning opportunities. It is possible to create these types of courses through Indigenous Studies in particular, but also in the faculties of Education and Law, and the Social Work program, for example. Experiential, including (but not limited to) land-based courses, can provide students with immersion experiences in language and community history and politics. If properly done, they will strengthen the Universityâ€™s relationships with Indigenous communities and increase possibilities for collaborations and research.

when: |-
  Medium term
how: |-
  Creating these opportunities requires building capacity by hiring additional Indigenous faculty members as well as appropriate supports in the form of Indigenous Affairs personnel within faculties.
cost: |-
  Set up a system of fee payment to communities. Students can pay additional tuition for experiential courses, but uOttawa needs to develop a policy for paying communities and/or knowledge keepers for their expertise, whether it is in the form of a sessional stipend to the additional instructors or a contribution agreement with the community, or both. This cost cannot be entirely assumed by students via tuition; this would be prohibitive for students.
