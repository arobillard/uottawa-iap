  Create a visiting Indigenous scholars program
why: |-
  The former Institute of Canadian and Aboriginal Studies had an <a href="https://arts.uottawa.ca/canada/en/research/visitorships">international visitorship program</a> which provides a letter of invitation and working space to different types of scholars looking to be in Ottawa. With the eventual closing of the Canadian Studies program, these visitorships will be reimagined as an Indigenous visiting scholars program.
when: |-
  Long term
how: |-
  Requires the collaboration of the Faculty of Arts and the newly formed IIRS. Partnerships with other faculties can help facilitate the recruitment of national and international Indigenous scholars with research expertise based on distinctive disciplinary perspectives, and assist with the funding of different events including, for instance, a speaker series and/or conference.
cost: |-
  To the extent that existing funds can be repurposed (see above), the incremental cost should be minimal.
who: |-
  Provost/Dean of Arts/Academic delegate for Indigenous engagement/Chair or Director, ICAS
