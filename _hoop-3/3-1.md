  Within each faculty, explore and implement inclusion of appropriate, traditional and contemporary Indigenous epistemological and ontological knowledge and methodological approaches into curriculums
why: |-
  While it is unlikely that all faculties will be able to hire Indigenous professors, this cannot be a barrier to including Indigenous epistemological and ontological knowledge and methodological approaches within their curriculums. Therefore, uOttawa encourages all teaching programs on campus to consider introducing Indigenous principles specific to their disciplines, because they have the potential to effectively support student learning while also promoting innovation through new forms of knowledge production. For instance, the Faculty of Engineering could work with Indigenous knowledge holders to develop curriculum around the principles of canoe and kayak construction or around the issues of water conservation, management and protection by working with knowledge holders who carry the teachings related to water. The Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics’ expertise in climate change could be strengthened by the introduction of traditional knowledge around hydrology, changes in plant life and animal behaviours. Curriculums will be supportive of generative practice. Additionally, support should be provided to those professors, departments and faculties interested in curriculum revitalization and transformation in this fashion.

  This dual strategy will engage Indigenous students more effectively and increase enrolment at uOttawa.
when: |-
  Short term
how: |-
  Ensuring that there are appropriate support people in various sectors of the campus, such as the Indigenous community engagement officer at Mashkawazìwogamig (position already filled) who can assist with building the appropriate community connections faculty members need to pursue new research programs.

  Additional support is required in the form of an Indigenous curriculum specialist within the TLSS to assist faculty members.

  This additionally requires the creation of a place within the University where there is a critical mass of Indigenous scholars who can bring in Indigenous intellectual traditions, to rethink existing fields, disciplines and approaches across campus (see hoop 2.2 and 2.3). It is not feasible for each program or faculty to develop this capacity on its own.

  There are also specific goals/targets that each faculty should meet to make this happen:
  - Each faculty should commit to seconding one or more of its professors to be trained as academic Indigenization leads.
  - Each faculty should establish a committee on academic Indigenization that will work with the Indigenous Affairs office and the academic Indigenization leads.
  - Training should be coordinated by the Indigenous Affairs office and the renewed Institute of Indigenous Research and Studies.
cost: |-
  Hire, at a minimum, one Indigenous curriculum specialist within the TLSS (with a goal to hire others as need arises).

  Potential for creation of new course code(s) as curriculum is redesigned due to research directions and outcomes.

  Provost/Deans/Vice-Provost, Academic Affairs/Vice-deans
