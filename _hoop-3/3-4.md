headline: |-
  Develop and implement a renaming and memorialization plan	
why: |-
  A number of universities have, in recent years, faced the need to consider carefully the principles for naming buildings because of protests around the historical legacy associated with particular figures (Yale, Ryerson and McGill, to name a few).
when: |-
  Medium to long term
how: |-
  The University will strike a committee to determine what the current principles on memorialization on campus are and then review whether there are places on campus that need to be renamed. It is best that we do this work ourselves before there are protests, given the history of the institution as a former Oblate owned and operated facility.
cost: |-
  Minimal aside from signage; requires solid preparation and investment of political capital by senior leadership
who: |-
  President/Provost/Senior leadership team
