  Increase Indigenous representation in exterior spaces
why: |-
  The goal is to transform the campus’ exterior spaces to be more welcoming to Indigenous people as they pass through our downtown space while also infusing the campus with an Indigenous aesthetic.
when: |-
  Medium term, following assessment
how: |-
  The University will undertake such actions as the renaming of campus streets, inscribing signs with words of welcome in multiple languages at key entrances to campus and commissioning an exterior mural in a high visibility area. Other actions will be developed in the context of campus master planning.

  Ensure that flags belonging to Indigenous nations—particularly Algonquin nations— are flown alongside the uOttawa flag when the University is hosting important/significant events, including the annual pow wow, and when dignitaries visit campus.
