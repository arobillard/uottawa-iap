  Provide a dedicated, stand-alone building for Indigenous Affairs that includes an appropriately sized and configured space for Mashkawazìwogamig: Indigenous Resource Centre
why: |-
  The current space allocated to Mashkawazìwogamig is small and inadequate for its needs. For instance, the IRC hosts a weekly soup and bannock event and the coordinator has to prepare the meal at home the evening before and bring it to campus. The IRC needs kitchen facilities as well as workstations, offices for the student organizations, a dedicated elders and/or ceremonial room and an activities space. It would also be ideal for the Indigenous Affairs staff to have dedicated office space that is not in the midst of student activity space.
when: |-
  Short term (urgent)
how: |-
  A space was identified in December 2018 and architects are currently drafting renovation plans with the intention of the Centre moving by summer 2020.
cost: |-
  A building simply needs to be retrofitted for the needs of the Centre.
who: |-
  Provost \| VP Resources \| academic delegate for Indigenous engagement \| Director, Indigenous Affairs
