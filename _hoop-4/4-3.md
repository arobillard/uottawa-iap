  Provide and support an Algonquin knowledge keeper-in-residence for Mashkawazìwogamig: Indigenous Resource Centre
why: |-
  Mashkawazìwogamig currently brings to the Centre several different knowledge keepers from various nations with different skills to engage with students in a variety of ways, from spiritual teachings and support to moccasin making. This program will continue to grow and support our students.

  The Centre requires, however, a permanent, rather than part-time, Algonquin knowledge keeper with some counselling experience to assist daily with issues of protocol and to advise on programming for students.
when: |-
  Short to long-term support
how: |-
  Academic delegate and director, Indigenous affairs, will work with local elders and communities to identify suitable candidates for such a position.
cost: |-
  Requires a salary (preferably not drawn from the PEFAL funding envelope) but also support for travel (e.g., mileage reimbursement, parking, subsistence) if the elder is travelling in from a nearby community such as Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation or the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation.
who: |-
  Academic delegate (to determine cost implications)/Deputy Provost, planning and academic budgets
