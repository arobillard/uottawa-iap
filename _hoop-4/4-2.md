  Promote youth engagement and outreach with communities and schools
why: |-
  Indigenous Affairs has collaborated with ACTUA to create a STEM mentorship program at Gloucester High School and with the Verna J. Kirkness Foundation to promote STEM fields to female Indigenous high school students. The Faculty of Education partnered with Màmawi Together to host the Youth for Reconciliation Day, which brought 250 high school students from four school boards to uOttawa, where they could learn about projects of reconciliation directly from Indigenous speakers and mentors.

  In addition to these existing collaborations, we can build pathways to host Indigenous youth on campus during the summer by having them participate in a variety of programs such as sports camp, literacy camp, debate/rhetoric club, math camp, etc.

  Camps such as this already exist at the University. They are offered annually in May across campus, through the <a href="https://engineering.uottawa.ca/outreach-programs/summer-programs-camps" />Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Arts/Engineering and the Enrichment Mini-Course Program</a>. All of these could be adapted to Indigenous-specific programming. We can also partner with Let’s Talk Science on campus regarding STEM- related programming for Indigenous youth.
