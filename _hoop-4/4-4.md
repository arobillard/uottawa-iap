  Provide support for Indigenous events and activities
why: |-
  Indigenous Affairs is responsible for hosting a range of activities on campus for students and staff for them to experience and participate in aspects of Indigenous culture including the annual pow wow, lectures by Indigenous speakers and other events.

  Dates and times in the calendar specifically commemorated by Indigenous peoples in Canada should be a part of the University calendar.

  Raise the profile of Indigenous intellectuals and activists by encouraging faculties to nominate at least one Indigenous person annually to receive an honorary doctorate.
when: |-
  Short term
how: |-
  Develop a list of dates and events that are central to the lives of Indigenous Canadians and ensure that uOttawa commemorates these dates. This list might include a dedicated holiday and/or days of observance such as Indigenous Peoples Day (21 June), Riel Day (16 Nov), Treaty Recognition Week (November), etc., to make Indigenous life a part of the campus

  Provide an annual reminder to faculties to consider nominating an Indigenous person who has had an impact on the lives of Indigenous societies for an honorary doctorate.
cost: |-
  There are no incremental resource implications to acknowledging these types of dates or pursuing these types of honorifics.
who: |-
  Communications Directorate/Ceremonies and Events/Provost/Deans (for nominations of honorary doctorate candidates)
