  Support the Indigenous Education Council
why: |-
  As of fall 2018, uOttawa has a reinvigorated and conceived Indigenous Education Council (IEC), which is working to determine its role within the university to promote student success (note that having a functioning IEC is a requirement for the university to receive PEFAL funding from the Province of Ontario’s Ministry of Education).
when: |-
  Medium to long term
how: |-
  The main requirement is a modest budgetary commitment to support travel by IEC members from their communities to Ottawa
cost: |-
  Three of uOttawa’s First Nations community representatives—from the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation and the Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation—are required to travel two hours to Ottawa. The University needs to establish an honorarium policy to cover the costs of travel and hotels, especially during inclement weather.

  Provost/Deputy Provost, Planning and Academic Budgets
